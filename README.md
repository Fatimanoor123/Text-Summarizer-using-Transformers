# 📝 Text Summarizer using Transformers

This is a simple AI-powered **Text Summarizer** built using Hugging Face's `transformers` library and a pre-trained summarization model (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`). It takes a long paragraph as input and returns a short, meaningful summary — just like ChatGPT, but focused on compressing text.
